* Device tree bindings for Atmel Flexcom (Flexible Serial Communication Unit)

The Atmel Flexcom is just a wrapper which embeds a SPI controller, an I2C
controller and an USART. Only one function can be used at a time and is chosen
at boot time according to the device tree.

Required properties:
- compatible: "atmel,sama5d2-flexcom"
- reg: shall be the offset/length value for Flexcom dedicated I/O registers
  (without USART, TWI or SPI registers).
- clocks: shall be the Flexcom peripheral clock from PMC.
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells: should be <1>
- ranges: one range for the full I/O register region (including USART, TWI and
  SPI registers)
- atmel,flexcom-mode: shall be a string among { "spi", "usart", "i2c", "twi" }.
  "i2c" and "twi" are synonymous.

Required child:
a child device of type matching the "atmel,flexcom-mode" property.
The reg property of this child should be:
- <0x200 0x200> for USART
- <0x400 0x200> for SPI
- <0x600 0x200> for I2C
The phandle provided by the clocks property of the child is the same as one for
the Flexcom parent.
Other properties remain unchanged. See documentation of the respective device.

Example:

flx0: flexcom@f8034000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-flexcom";
	reg = <0xf8034000 0x200>;
	clocks = <&flx0_clk>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0x0 0xf8034000 0x800>;
	atmel,flexcom-mode = "spi";

	spi@f8034400 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-spi";
		reg = <0x400 0x200>;
		interrupts = <19 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 7>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_flx0_ioset1>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&flx0_clk>;
		clock-names = "spi_clk";
		atmel,fifo-size = <32>;

		mtd_dataflash@0 {
			compatible = "atmel,at25f512b";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <20000000>;
		};
	};
};
